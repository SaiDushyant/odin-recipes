    <h1>Buttered Noodles</h1>
    <img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/_-fntqlbxLl8Nx3Ll5apxQFGF9Q=/0x512/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/244458-buttered-noodles-DDMFS-4x3-b9931662efa64b37883c0f73b296b124.jpg" alt="Noodles image">
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Noodles: This recipe calls for fettuccine noodles, but you could use any noodles you have on hand, from penne to spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Butter: You can use salted or unsalted butter. Since you'll add more salt at the end, you might want to opt for unsalted (depending on your taste, of course).</li>
        <li>Parmesan: Grated Parmesan cheese takes this dish up a notch. Buttered noodles don't technically require cheese, so you can leave it out if you want.</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper: Finish off this easy buttered noodles recipe with salt and ground black pepper.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the fettuccine in lightly salted water until it's tender, yet still firm.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta in a colander, then return it to the pot.</li>
        <li>Mix butter, cheese, salt, and pepper into the cooked noodles until all the ingredients are evenly combined.</li>
    </ol>
